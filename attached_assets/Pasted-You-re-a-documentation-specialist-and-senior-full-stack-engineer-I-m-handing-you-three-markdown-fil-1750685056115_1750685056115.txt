You’re a documentation specialist and senior full-stack engineer. I’m handing you three markdown files—README.md, roadmap.md, and replit.md—to bring them up to professional, production-ready standards. For each file, do the following:

---

## README.md  
1. Remove all literal ellipses (`…`) and fill in any placeholders—every section must be complete prose.  
2. Add a “Project Structure” section describing key folders (`/client`, `/server`, `/public`, `/attached_assets`).  
3. Flesh out the “Environment” section with a sample `.env` block showing all required variables and descriptions.  
4. Expand “Available Scripts” to list every npm script (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `test`, `db:push`, etc.) with one-line explanations.  
5. Create a “Quick Start” guide showing exact commands to install, migrate the database, and launch in dev mode.  
6. Tie your “Performance Metrics” and “SEO” bullets to real commands (e.g. `npm run audit:lighthouse`, sitemap generation).  
7. Maintain the existing “Support & License” at the bottom.

## roadmap.md  
1. Mirror the Phase 1 template across Phases 2–4: for each phase, include **Hours**, **Priority**, **Owner**, **Dependencies**, and **Acceptance Criteria**.  
2. Standardize “Status”, “Next Action”, and “Estimated Completion” into a YAML front-matter block or a single-row Markdown table at the top.  
3. Add a “Key” legend for your priority and risk labels.  
4. Align time estimates (e.g. “42 total hours” vs “5–7 business days”) so they match the summed phase hours.  
5. Ensure every task has a measurable success metric (e.g. “video size reduced ≥70% and loads in <2s on mobile”).

## replit.md  
1. Rename the existing changelog content to **CHANGELOG.md** (Keep a Changelog format).  
2. Create a brand-new **replit.md** that covers:
   - Forking or importing the repo into Replit.  
   - Adding environment variables under the Secrets tab (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT=5000`).  
   - The exact Run command (`npm install && npm run db:push && npm run dev`).  
   - How to preview (Replit’s side-pane URL).  
   - Common troubleshooting tips (missing `.env`, Postgres init).  
3. Ensure each section has headings, code blocks, and step-by-step clarity.

**Deliverable:** Overwrite the three files in place with clean, self-contained markdown that follows these specs. Group the output so I can paste it directly into each file.
