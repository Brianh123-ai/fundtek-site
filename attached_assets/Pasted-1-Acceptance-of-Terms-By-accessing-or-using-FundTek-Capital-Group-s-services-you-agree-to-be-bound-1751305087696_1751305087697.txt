1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using FundTek Capital Group’s services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. FundTek Capital Group operates as a business funding broker, connecting qualified businesses with independent lending partners.

2. Services Provided
We provide business funding consultation, application support, and lender matchmaking. FundTek Capital Group does not directly lend capital; instead, we facilitate access to funding options through our network of lending partners.

3. Broker Relationship
FundTek Capital Group is an independent broker, not affiliated with any specific lender. We work to present multiple funding options when possible. Final lending decisions—including terms, amounts, and approvals—are made solely by the lenders.

4. Application Process
Submitting an application through our platform does not guarantee approval or funding. Each lending partner applies its own underwriting criteria. We strive to match your profile with appropriate lenders but cannot guarantee specific offers or outcomes.

5. Client Responsibilities
You are responsible for ensuring that all information provided to FundTek Capital Group is truthful, complete, and accurate. Providing false, misleading, or incomplete information may result in denial of funding and/or termination of service. We reserve the right to verify any information submitted.

6. Compensation
FundTek Capital Group may receive compensation from lending partners upon successful referral or funding. This compensation does not impact the terms or cost of your funding. Any fees payable directly by you will be disclosed in advance and require your consent.

7. Confidentiality & Data Use
We treat all client information as confidential. Your data will only be shared with potential funding partners for the purpose of evaluating and securing financing. We do not sell or disclose your information for marketing purposes without explicit permission.

8. Limitation of Liability
FundTek Capital Group provides brokerage and referral services only. We are not responsible for lending decisions, funding timelines, or final terms. Our liability is strictly limited to services directly rendered by us, and we make no guarantees regarding outcomes.

9. Updates to Terms
These Terms of Service may be updated periodically. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the latest version. We will notify users of material changes when feasible.
