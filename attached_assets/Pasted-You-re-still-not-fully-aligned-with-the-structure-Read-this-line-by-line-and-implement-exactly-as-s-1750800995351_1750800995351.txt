‚úÖ Pages That Are GOOD ‚Äî No Changes Needed:
Trucking

Medical

Professional Services

Technology

Auto

Beauty

Hospitality

Agriculture

Events

Education

Franchises

üîß Pages That NEED FIXES:
1. Construction
Problem: Rolling Statistic is at the bottom

Fix: Move it directly above the #success-stories or .success-stories section in the DOM hierarchy.

DO NOT wrap it inside success-stories or place it anywhere else.

2. Restaurants
Problem: Duplicate rolling stats ‚Äî one blue, one white.

Fix: Remove the blue variant. Keep only the white version of the rolling number.

Ensure it appears only once, above Success Stories.

3. Retail
Problem: Clicking causes entire site to crash

Fix:

Run dev tools console ‚Üí find JS errors or null data access

Check for broken imports, routing issues, or malformed component props.

Confirm route is stable on page load and on direct access via URL.

4. Manufacturing
Problem: Page causes crash.

Fix:

Same debug process as above (console > error trace > fix)

Confirm if the component is mounting before data is injected

Validate all props and remove unhandled exceptions

5. Real Estate
Problem: Hero section has invisible white box

Fix:

Identify the box (div, container, etc.) with white background and no border

Set background color to #85abe4 and change text color to #ffffff (white)

This box should look like a clean CTA or header module

6. Home Services
Problem: Page crashes on click

Fix:

Console debug and fix broken import, data-fetch, or routing logic

Validate DOM rendering before component mount

7. Cleaning Services
Problems:

Rolling Statistic is at the bottom ‚Äî move it above Success Stories

Console error: Monitor is not defined

Fix:

Move stat to correct DOM location (same as Construction)

For Monitor error:

Check if an undefined variable or script is being called

Likely a reference to a missing import or improperly scoped variable

Fix or remove the monitor logic if not in use, or import it correctly
