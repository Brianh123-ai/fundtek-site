You are a senior UX/UI designer, content strategist, and mobile-first specialist. Perform a full audit of the website ocused on three pillars—Text, Visualization, and Mobile Optimization—and deliver:
1. Text Content Audit
Readability & Tone: Analyze each page’s copy with Flesch-Kincaid and Gunning Fog. Flag anything below 8th-grade reading level or off-brand tone.


Keyword & Messaging Alignment: Check primary and secondary keyword density against our target list. Identify missing CTAs or unclear value propositions.


Hierarchy & Scannability: Evaluate headings, subheads, bullets and paragraph length. Recommend reorganizing or rewriting to maximize scan-ability.


Calls to Action: Inventory every CTA—button text, inline links, forms. Rate clarity and urgency, and suggest 3 stronger variants per page.


2. Visualization & Design Audit
Brand Consistency: Verify logo, color palette, typography scale, iconography and spacing against our style guide. Highlight any deviations.


Imagery & Media Quality: Review all images, videos and illustrations for resolution, relevance, ALT text, and loading strategy. Recommend replacements or optimizations.


Layout & Hierarchy: Assess use of white space, grid alignment, content grouping and visual flow. Propose layout tweaks (e.g. card structures, modular blocks) with wireframe examples.


Interaction & Feedback: Test buttons, links, forms and hover/focus states. Identify missing affordances or feedback cues and prescribe micro-interaction patterns.


3. Mobile Optimization
Responsive Breakpoints: Audit key breakpoints (320–480px, 481–768px, 769–1024px). Document layout or overflow issues, font-size regressions, and touch-target violations.


Content Prioritization: Ensure above-the-fold content is lean and actionable on mobile. Recommend content reflow or collapse strategies for lengthy sections.


Performance on Mobile: Report first-load payloads on 3G/4G simulation, critical CSS coverage, and lazy-load status for images/videos. Provide a prioritized fix list to hit LCP < 2.5 s.


Accessibility & Tap-Target Size: Check button/link sizes (min 44×44 px), color contrast and zoom behavior. Supply precise CSS overrides to guarantee touch usability.


4. Executive Deliverables
A consolidated report (PDF or Google Doc) with top 5 issues per pillar, each with severity (High/Medium/Low), impact vs. effort, and exact rewrite or code snippets.


A “quick-win” checklist you can implement in one afternoon and a roadmap for deeper fixes over the next sprint.


IF any texts on any page visible or hidden. The navigator is unreadable fix all that up how it was fixed.
