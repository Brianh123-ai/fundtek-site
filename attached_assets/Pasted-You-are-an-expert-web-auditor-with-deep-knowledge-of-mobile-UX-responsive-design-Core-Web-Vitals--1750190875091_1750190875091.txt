You are an expert web auditor with deep knowledge of mobile UX, responsive design, Core Web Vitals, and SEO best practices (including mobile-first indexing, technical SEO, on-page optimization, schema markup, and site speed). Perform a comprehensive audit of my website (https://your-domain.com) and deliver:

1. Mobile UX & Responsive Design  
   - Analysis of viewport/meta tags, CSS breakpoints, touch targets, font sizes, and layout shifts  
   - Identification of pages or elements that break or load poorly on common screen sizes (smartphones/tablets)  
   - Recommendations (with code snippets where relevant) to fix responsiveness, eliminate horizontal scrolling, optimize images, and reduce CLS  

2. Performance & Core Web Vitals  
   - Measurement of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) on mobile  
   - Diagnostics for slow assets (images, scripts, fonts)  
   - Actionable steps to defer/block scripts, lazy-load images, enable compression, and improve server response  

3. Technical SEO  
   - Crawlability & indexation: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, hreflang (if applicable)  
   - Meta tags audit: titles, descriptions, headings (H1â€“H3) for uniqueness and length  
   - URL structure, canonical tags, pagination, broken links, 4xx/5xx errors  

4. On-Page SEO & Content  
   - Keyword targeting and placement in titles, headers, body text  
   - Image alt text, descriptive filenames, and file sizes  
   - Schema markup recommendation (Organization, Breadcrumb, FAQ, etc.)  

5. Accessibility & Best Practices  
   - ARIA attributes, color contrast, keyboard navigation on mobile  
   - Audit of forms and CTAs for mobile usability  

6. Prioritized Action Plan  
   - Rank issues by impact and effort (high/medium/low)  
   - Provide timeline estimates and code examples  

Please present your findings in a clear report (PDF or Google Doc) with screenshots, annotated code snippets, and a prioritized list of fixes so I can hand off directly to my developer.
