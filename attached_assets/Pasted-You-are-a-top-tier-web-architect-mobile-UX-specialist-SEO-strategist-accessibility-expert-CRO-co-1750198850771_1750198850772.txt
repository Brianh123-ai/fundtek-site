You are a top-tier web architect, mobile UX specialist, SEO strategist, accessibility expert, CRO consultant and QA engineer. Audit and overhaul my site end-to-end. Deliver:

1. **Performance & Stability**  
   - Run Lighthouse or Calibre: report FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT, TTI, TTFB. Identify top 3 critical bottlenecks with code/config fixes.  
   - Set performance budgets and before/after targets.

2. **Mobile-First UX & Responsiveness**  
   - Test on 320â€“480px, 481â€“768px, 769â€“1024px. List layout issues, touch targets, font legibility.  
   - Provide CSS/HTML refactors: fluid grids, media queries, srcset images, inline critical CSS, lazy-load assets.

3. **Visual & Interaction Design**  
   - Audit color contrast, typography scale, spacing, hierarchy. Propose a design system (variables, scale).  
   - Supply component code (Tailwind or your stack) for nav, buttons, cards, forms; include micro-interactions (hover/focus transitions).

4. **Technical SEO & Content Strategy**  
   - Crawl entire site: report missing/duplicate titles, meta descriptions, H1â€“H6 issues, XML sitemap, robots.txt.  
   - **Link & Page QA**: check HTTP status for every internal/external link; flag 404s, 5xx, redirect loops/chains; provide fix steps.  
   - Keyword map for top 10 terms, map to pages; generate optimized title/meta, H1 outline, 300-word content snippet for one key page.  
   - Recommend JSON-LD schema (Organization, Breadcrumbs, FAQ) with examples.

5. **Accessibility & Compliance**  
   - Identify WCAG 2.1 AA failures (ARIA labels, contrast, keyboard nav); supply precise HTML/CSS fixes.  
   - Ensure screen-reader compatibility and logical tab order.

6. **Conversion Rate & Analytics**  
   - Review CTAs, form UX, funnel drop-off; suggest 2â€“3 A/B test hypotheses.  
   - Outline GA4/Tag Manager integration and key events (clicks, form submits).

7. **Security & Best Practices**  
   - Audit HTTP headers (CSP, HSTS), SSL/TLS, mixed content; provide config snippets.  
   - Recommend backup, monitoring and uptime tools.

8. **Roadmap & Reporting**  
   - Prioritized action plan: issue, severity (H/M/L), impact vs. effort, owner (dev/SEO/designer).  
   - Bundle code snippets, CLI commands, link-audit report and before/after targets into a single PDF or Google Doc.
