You are a senior full-stack engineer. I’m handing you my entire website codebase and I need a complete health check. Please:

1. **Code Quality & Consistency**  
   - Run ESLint (with TypeScript rules) and Stylelint across all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.css` files. Report syntax errors, unused variables/imports, inconsistent formatting, or missing type annotations.  
   - Verify that ESLint and Prettier configs exist and enforce them.

2. **Dependency & Security Audit**  
   - Perform `npm audit` (or `yarn audit`) and flag any high- or critical-severity vulnerabilities.  
   - Check for outdated packages and suggest updates.  
   - Scan server-side code for injection risks (SQL, XSS, command injection) and confirm proper input sanitization and use of parameterized queries.

3. **Performance & Build**  
   - Analyze the build output (Webpack/Rollup/Next) for bundle size, identify the largest modules, and recommend code-splitting or dynamic imports.  
   - Verify that image and video assets are optimized (compressed, converted to modern formats like WebP or AVIF) and that lazy-loading is in place.  
   - Ensure CSS and JavaScript are minified and that tree-shaking is effective.

4. **SEO & Accessibility**  
   - Run Lighthouse audits focusing on SEO and Accessibility. Report missing or misconfigured meta tags, titles, descriptions, structured data (JSON-LD), `alt` attributes, ARIA roles, and color-contrast issues.  
   - Confirm that server-rendered pages include proper `<meta>` tags and sitemap.

5. **Responsive & Cross-Browser**  
   - Test major breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) and report any layout or touch-target problems.  
   - Spot-check functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari for JS errors or rendering quirks.

6. **CI/CD & Environment**  
   - Review CI/CD workflows: confirm that tests run on each commit, linting passes, and that environment variables are handled securely.  
   - Ensure rollback strategies exist and that production secrets aren’t exposed.

7. **Monitoring & Error Tracking**  
   - Check for integration with error-tracking (Sentry, LogRocket) or performance monitoring tools. Report any pages or API routes lacking instrumentation.
