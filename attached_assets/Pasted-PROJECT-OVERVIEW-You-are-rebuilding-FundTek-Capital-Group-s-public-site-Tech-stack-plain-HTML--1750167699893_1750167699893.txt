PROJECT OVERVIEW
You are rebuilding FundTek Capital Group’s public site.
Tech stack: plain HTML + Tailwind CSS + vanilla JS (no frameworks, no inline styles).
Reference ONLY the *layout structure* of pmfus.com’s Home and Solutions pages.
**Do not copy** their wording, images, icons, or code—create fresh FundTek copy and media.

PAGES TO DELIVER
1. Home  (index.html)
2. Solutions  (solutions.html)
3. Who We Fund  (who-we-fund.html)
4. Apply Now  (apply.html)
5. Resources  (resources.html)
6. Contact  (contact.html)
7. Twelve hidden landers under /solutions/[slug].html

DESIGN RULES
● Invisible-until-scroll black nav containing the six pages above—no extras.  
● Hero on Home: full-width autoplay video, right-aligned headline + subhead.  
● Immediately below: four-stat banner (mirror pmfus spacing, fresh FundTek stats).  
● Working-Capital section includes an embedded JotForm (ID will be supplied later).  
● Solutions page shows a 3 × 4 grid of product cards, each “Learn More” → hidden lander.  
● Hidden landers: skyline hero with parallax, sections for How It Works → Qualify → Apply.  
● Footer: © 2025 FundTek Capital Group, LLC · 646-XXX-XXXX · social icons (placeholders).  
● Live-chat widget (Tidio-style) loads 4 s after idle.

CONTENT RULES
● All headlines, blurbs, and CTAs must be original FundTek copy—run through Copyscape.  
● No lorem-ipsum; write short, benefit-driven text in FundTek’s voice (direct, confident).  
● Each Solutions card and hidden lander must include unique JSON-LD Product schema.

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
● Tailwind utility classes only—no custom CSS files.  
● JavaScript bundle < 5 KB gzipped.  
● Pages must score ≥ 90 on Lighthouse performance.  
● htmlhint and lychee link checker must return zero errors.  
● Every commit message follows Conventional Commits (“feat: nav scaffold”, etc.).  
● Add robots:noindex to all hidden landers and omit them from sitemap.xml.

WORKFLOW
1. **Stage 1:** deliver bare-bones Home page (sections empty except hero + nav) for approval.  
2. **Stage 2:** flesh out Home (stat banner, Working Capital section) and build Solutions grid.  
3. **Stage 3:** generate 12 hidden lander stubs, unique copy + schema each.  
4. **Stage 4:** build remaining site pages (Who We Fund, Apply Now, Resources, Contact).  
5. **Stage 5:** polish, run tests, attach Lighthouse report.
