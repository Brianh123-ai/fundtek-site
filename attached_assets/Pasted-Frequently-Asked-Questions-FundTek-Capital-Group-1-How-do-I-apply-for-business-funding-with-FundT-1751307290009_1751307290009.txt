Frequently Asked Questions – FundTek Capital Group
1. How do I apply for business funding with FundTek?
You can start the process by completing our short application online or through one of our funding specialists. We’ll ask for basic business and financial information to match you with the most suitable funding options.

2. How long does the funding process take?
We move fast. Most clients receive approval within 24 hours, and funding can be deposited as quickly as the same or next business day after approval and document signing.

3. How much can I get approved for?
Funding amounts typically range from $10,000 to $750,000, depending on your revenue, business health, and lender criteria. High-volume businesses may qualify for even more.

4. Do you fund all industries?
Yes. We work with business owners across all industries, including trucking, medical, restaurants, retail, construction, e-commerce, and more. Some industries may receive better terms based on stability and revenue trends.

5. Do I need perfect credit to qualify?
No. We focus more on your business performance than your personal credit. A credit score of 500+ is often enough for short-term funding. For larger approvals or SBA options, stronger credit may help secure better terms.

6. Will applying affect my credit?
We do a soft pull during the pre-qualification stage, which does not affect your credit score. A hard inquiry may occur later only if you choose to move forward with a specific offer.

7. What are the repayment terms like?
We offer flexible repayment options, including daily, weekly, and monthly schedules. Terms can range from 3 to 24 months depending on the funding product and your cash flow.

8. Are there any upfront fees?
No upfront fees. We don’t charge you anything to apply, get matched, or receive offers. If any costs are involved, they will be clearly disclosed by the lender before funding.

9. What documents will I need to apply?
Typically, you’ll need:

Last 3–6 months of business bank statements

Driver’s license

Voided check

Completed application
Additional documents may be requested depending on the lender and product type.

10. Can I use funding for any purpose?
Yes. Whether it's payroll, equipment, expansion, marketing, or debt consolidation, you can use the funds however your business needs it.

11. What’s the minimum revenue required to apply?
Most lenders require a minimum of $15,000 per month in gross business revenue. The higher your revenue, the stronger your options.

12. Can I get funding if I already have other advances or loans?
Yes. Many of our clients have active positions. We can look into consolidations, reverse consolidations, or add-on funding based on your situation.

13. What’s the approval based on?
Lenders primarily evaluate your average monthly revenue, consistency of cash flow, number of negative days, and existing obligations. The cleaner the file, the better the offer.

14. Is this a loan or a cash advance?
We offer both. FundTek connects you to multiple options, including merchant cash advances, term loans, lines of credit, and SBA products. We'll help you choose what’s best based on your goals.

15. What happens after I’m approved?
Once approved, you'll receive your offer details. If you choose to move forward, you'll sign a funding agreement and submit any final documents. Funds are typically wired to your business account within hours.
