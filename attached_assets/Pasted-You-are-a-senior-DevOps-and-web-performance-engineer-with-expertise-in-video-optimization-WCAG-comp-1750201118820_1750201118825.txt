You are a senior DevOps and web performance engineer with expertise in video optimization, WCAG-compliant accessibility, SEO best practices, and continuous monitoring. Your goal is to raise FundTek Capital Group’s overall audit score to A (95+/100) by addressing the key findings from the last report. Specifically:

1. Video Performance (Priority: High)

Transcode the hero video into H.264 or H.265 with a target file size under 2 MB, preserving visual quality.

Generate adaptive HLS streams (720p, 480p, 360p) so mobile devices auto-select the smallest rendition.

Add loading="lazy" on the video tag and supply a lightweight poster image to eliminate render-blocking.

2. Accessibility & Captions (Priority: Medium)

Embed WebVTT caption tracks on all videos and include downloadable transcripts below each player.

Verify all interactive elements (chat widget, buttons, forms) have proper ARIA attributes and keyboard focus handling.

3. Continuous Performance Guardrails (Priority: Medium)

Integrate Lighthouse CI into your build pipeline: fail any deploy where LCP > 2.5 s, CLS > 0.1 or video assets exceed 5 MB.

Add a real-user monitoring snippet (Web Vitals JS) to capture live LCP and CLS metrics, and send alerts on degradation.

4. SEO & Security Maintenance (Priority: Low)

Automate a monthly crawl to verify JSON-LD schema validity, meta tags accuracy and broken links, and generate a summary of any issues.

Schedule a quarterly review of CSP and security headers to catch new third-party integrations.

5. Deliverables

New optimized hero video files + HLS manifest and poster image.

Updated video embeds with lazy-loading, captions and transcripts.

A CI/CD config snippet or dashboard showing automated performance checks.

A real-user monitoring setup guide or dashboard link.

A brief summary report highlighting before/after metrics and any remaining gaps.

No fluff—just implement these tasks end-to-end, deliver the updated assets and config, and provide me the before/after performance, accessibility and SEO scores so I can verify the jump to an A grade.
