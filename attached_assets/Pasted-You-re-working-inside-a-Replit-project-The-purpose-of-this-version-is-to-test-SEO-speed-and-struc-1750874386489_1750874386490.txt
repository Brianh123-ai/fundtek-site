You’re working inside a Replit project. The purpose of this version is to test SEO, speed, and structural enhancements without breaking layout, design, or functionality.
You are not allowed to alter the design in any way. This includes:
❌ No layout shifts (header, footer, spacing, padding, button placement, etc.)


❌ No changes to visual styles (colors, fonts, shadows, hover effects)


❌ No lazy loading or replacing the homepage hero video


❌ No mobile stack changes or responsive behavior edits


❌ No plugin injections or external libraries unless approved



✅ Your job is to enhance the site under the hood only:
1. Meta & Schema
Add/rewrite unique meta titles (~60 char) and descriptions (~160 char) for all public pages


Implement Organization or LocalBusiness schema with placeholder or real NAP info


Add FAQPage and Review schema where it makes sense


Use Google’s Rich Results Test to validate


2. Crawlability Prep
Create a clean robots.txt file (allow all for now)


Prepare a sitemap.xml with proper page paths (use placeholder domain)


Do not submit to Search Console until site is hosted


Make sure there are no 404s or broken internal links


3. Core Web Vitals
Optimize LCP/INP/CLS:


✅ Minify CSS/JS


✅ Compress images to WebP (but not hero video)


✅ Enable caching and async where safe


Do not lazy-load, defer, or alter the hero video


Do not defer anything that causes a visual delay


4. Content Structure
Adjust heading tags (H1 > H2 > H3) for semantic structure only


Inject keywords naturally into copy if relevant


Do not rewrite content tone, formatting, or length unless requested


5. Mobile Check
Confirm mobile version displays identically to the original


Font sizing, spacing, and touch targets may be adjusted only if readability is an issue


Do not modify stacking order, menu design, or visibility logic


6. Other
Add a clean custom 404 page with CTA or nav links


Add canonical tags where needed (no duplicate content issues)


Document all changes clearly in comments or a changelog file



🚨 If any change causes the site to look, feel, or behave differently than the original version — stop immediately and roll back. You are operating in a test zone where the only approved changes are invisible improvements.
