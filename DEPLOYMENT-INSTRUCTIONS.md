# Deployment Instructions for FundTek Capital Group

## Build Process Status âœ…

The build process is working correctly and creates `dist/index.js` as required by the deployment system.

### What was fixed:
1. **Build Output Path**: Changed from `--outdir=dist` to `--outfile=dist/index.js`
2. **ESM Module Support**: Added `package.json` with `"type": "module"` to dist directory
3. **Module Banner**: Added createRequire import for Node.js compatibility

### Build Script

A custom build script `build-for-deployment.js` has been created that:
- Cleans the dist directory
- Builds frontend with Vite (output to `dist/public/`)
- Builds server with esbuild (output to `dist/index.js`)
- Adds ESM module support
- Verifies build output

### To Deploy:

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   node build-for-deployment.js
   ```

2. **Verify the build**:
   - Check that `dist/index.js` exists (should be ~130KB)
   - Check that `dist/public/` contains frontend assets
   - Check that `dist/package.json` exists

3. **The deployment system will use**:
   - Build command: `npm run build` (or `node build-for-deployment.js`)
   - Start command: `npm start` (which runs `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`)

### Important Notes:

- The server runs on port 5000 by default
- Environment variables needed:
  - `DATABASE_URL` (automatically provided by Replit)
  - `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (should be set for production)
  - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (optional, for email functionality)

- The `.replit` configuration is set up correctly with:
  ```toml
  [deployment]
  deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
  build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
  run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
  ```

### Troubleshooting:

If deployment still fails:
1. Check deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all environment variables are set
3. Verify database connection is working
4. Check that port 5000 is properly mapped to port 80 in `.replit`

The application is now ready for deployment! ðŸš€
