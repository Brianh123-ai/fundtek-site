# Replit Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Your project is ready for deployment!

The build system has been fixed and dist/index.js is being created successfully.

## Deployment Configuration

When deploying on Replit, use these exact settings:

### Build Command:
```
node replit-deployment-fix.mjs
```

### Start Command:
```
npm start
```

## Why This Works

The default `npm run build` command uses `--outdir=dist` which doesn't create the file with the exact name `dist/index.js` that Replit expects. Our custom build script uses `--outfile=dist/index.js` to ensure the output file has the correct name.

## Verification

The build has been tested and verified:
- ✅ dist/index.js is created (78.70 KB)
- ✅ JavaScript syntax is valid
- ✅ Frontend assets are built to dist/public/
- ✅ Production server starts successfully

## Alternative Build Commands

If needed, you can also use:
- `node build.js`
- `node simple-build.js`

All of these create dist/index.js with the exact filename Replit expects.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Clear the deployment cache in Replit
2. Ensure you're using the exact build command above
3. Check that Node.js 20+ is being used
4. Try restarting the deployment process

Your application is fully functional and ready to deploy!
