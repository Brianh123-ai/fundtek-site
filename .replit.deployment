# Replit Deployment Configuration
# This file helps ensure correct deployment

# Build command that creates dist/index.js with the exact filename
build = "node replit-deployment-fix.mjs"

# Start command
run = "npm start"

# Environment
NODE_ENV = "production"

# Notes:
# - The default npm run build uses --outdir which doesn't create dist/index.js
# - Our custom build script uses --outfile to ensure the exact filename
# - This configuration ensures Replit deployment succeeds
