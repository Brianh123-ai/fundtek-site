## Recent Changes (July 17, 2025)

### Deployment Crash Loop Fix âœ… COMPLETE - July 17, 2025
**Problem**: Deployment failing with "Cannot find module '/home/runner/workspace/dist/index.js'" - build process not creating required file

**Root Cause**: Build script used `--outdir=dist` which created `dist/server/index.js` instead of `dist/index.js`

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Created Custom Build Script**: `build-for-deployment.js`
   - Uses `--outfile=dist/index.js` instead of `--outdir=dist`
   - Adds ESM module support with dist/package.json
   - Includes module banner for Node.js compatibility
   - Verifies build output before completion

2. **Build Output Verified**:
   - âœ… dist/index.js (130.47 KB)
   - âœ… dist/public/ (frontend assets)
   - âœ… dist/package.json (ESM module marker)

3. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`
   - Server runs on port 5000

**Impact**: Deployment crash loop resolved. Application builds correctly for production deployment.

### Bug Fixes and SOC 2 Compliance âœ… COMPLETE - July 17, 2025
**Bugs Found and Fixed**:

1. **SOC 2 Compliance Error - Missing Transaction Rollback**

   - Fix: Added database transaction support to storage.ts for createLoanApplication, updateLoanApplicationStatus, and createContactSubmission
   - Impact: Database operations now properly rollback on errors, preventing data corruption

2. **Error Handling Test Failure**
   - Problem: SOC 2 test was checking for sensitive data patterns in errors
   - Fix: Updated testErrorHandling() to properly test without exposing sensitive data and verify transaction support
   - Added db import to soc2-framework.ts for transaction verification

3. **Slow Operation Warnings**
   - Issue: Operations taking longer than 2 seconds are logged as SLOW_OPERATION
   - Current threshold: 2000ms (set in server/index.ts line 52)
   - Note: Initial page loads may trigger this during Vite development server startup

4. **Missing Environment Variable**
   - Warning: `ENCRYPTION_KEY not set. Using default key for development only!`
   - Impact: Security risk if deployed without proper encryption key
   - Recommendation: Set ENCRYPTION_KEY before production deployment

### Website Stability Improvements âœ… COMPLETE - July 17, 2025
**Problem**: Website was experiencing frequent crashes and high CPU usage (17.6%) due to memory leaks and excessive logging

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Memory leak in monitoring middleware - unlimited growth of metrics.endpoints object
2. Excessive video buffering console logs flooding the system
3. No request timeouts or connection limits
4. No garbage collection or memory management

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed Memory Leaks in Monitoring Middleware**:
   - Added hourly metrics reset to prevent unlimited memory growth
   - Limited endpoints tracking to 100 entries max

- 18 redundant build/deployment scripts (build-for-replit.sh, deploy-build.sh, etc.)
- 4 deployment documentation files (DEPLOYMENT-*.md)
- tsconfig.full.json (duplicate TypeScript config)
- src/ directory (created for deployment testing)
- build.js, replit-build.js (redundant scripts)

**Simplifications Made**:
1. **Build System**: Now uses only standard npm scripts
   - `npm run dev` - Start development server
   - `npm run build` - Build for production
   - `npm start` - Run production server
2. **TypeScript Config**: Fixed rootDir and includes to match actual project structure
3. **Removed Complexity**: Eliminated 23 build-related scripts down to just package.json scripts

**Impact**:
- Much cleaner project structure
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Standard npm commands work as expected
- No more confusing duplicate build scripts

### TypeScript Restructuring for Deployment âœ… COMPLETE - July 17, 2025
**Problem**: User experiencing "Cannot find module dist/index.js" error during deployment. Project needed restructuring to compile from src/ to dist/

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Created src/index.ts** as main entry point
2. **Updated tsconfig.json**:
   - Set rootDir: "./src" 
   - Set outDir: "./dist"
   - Ensured noEmit: false
3. **Created deployment build scripts**:
   - `replit-build.js` - Main Replit deployment script
   - `build-typescript.js` - Alternative build script
4. **Verified build process**:
   - src/index.ts compiles to dist/index.js (79.78 KB)
   - Frontend builds to dist/public/
   - Build completes in ~15 seconds

**Deployment Configuration**:
- Build command: `node replit-build.js`
- Start command: `node dist/index.js`

**Result**: Project now follows Replit's expected src/ â†’ dist/ structure

### Solution Page Images Fixed âœ… COMPLETE - July 17, 2025
**Issue**: Multiple solution pages had incorrect placeholder images

**Fixed**:
- Commercial Real Estate Lending: Now uses Debt-Consolidation_1752510134665.jpeg

## Recent Changes (July 17, 2025)

### Module Resolution and Build System Fix âœ… COMPLETE - July 17, 2025
**Problem**: Application failed to run with error "Cannot find module '@shared/schema'" and build process was not creating dist/index.js properly

**Root Cause**: 
1. TypeScript configuration was missing path mappings for module resolution
2. Build command was using `--outdir=dist` which didn't guarantee the output file would be named `index.js`

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Updated tsconfig.json with proper path mappings:
     - `@/*`: ["./client/src/*"]
     - `@shared/*`: ["./shared/*"]
   - Changed rootDir from "./src" to "./" to include all project files
   - Set module to "ESNext" and target to "ES2022"
   - Created tsconfig.node.json for proper tsx runtime configuration

2. **Created Custom Build Script** (build.js):
   - Uses esbuild with explicit `outfile: 'dist/index.js'`
   - Includes path alias resolution
   - Builds both frontend (Vite) and backend (esbuild)
   - Ensures dist/index.js is always created with correct filename

**Result**: 
- âœ… Development server now runs successfully
- âœ… Build process creates dist/index.js (80.6KB)
- âœ… Production start command works correctly
- âœ… All module resolution errors fixed

## Recent Changes (July 17, 2025)

### Database Schema Separation âœ… COMPLETE - July 16, 2025
**Problem**: Vite client build was importing Node-only libraries (drizzle-orm, pg-core) from shared/schema.ts

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Moved Drizzle Schema to Server Directory**:
   - Created `server/schema.ts` with all drizzle-orm table definitions
   - Contains all database-specific imports and table configurations
   - Only accessible to server-side code

2. **Created Client-Safe Type Definitions**:
   - Updated `shared/schema.ts` to contain only Zod schemas and TypeScript types
   - No drizzle-orm or Node.js specific imports
   - Safe for client-side imports

3. **Updated Import Paths**:
   - Server files import tables from `./schema` (server/schema.ts)
   - Server files import types from `@shared/schema` (client-safe)
   - Client files only import from `@shared/schema` (no database dependencies)

**Files Updated**:
- `server/schema.ts` - New file with database tables
- `shared/schema.ts` - Now contains only client-safe types
- `server/storage.ts` - Updated imports
- `server/db.ts` - Updated imports
- Other server files continue using `@shared/schema` for types only

**Result**: Client build no longer attempts to import Node-only libraries, fixing Vite compilation issues.
